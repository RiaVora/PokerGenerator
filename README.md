# PokerGenerator
The purpose of the PokerGenerator assignment was to follow the five exercises and create code that shuffled through a deck of cards, returned multiple different scenarios (the probability of a ThreeOfAKind, etc.), and that created classes for Rational and Complex numbers. Please check the README for more.
