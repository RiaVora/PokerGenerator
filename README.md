# PokerGenerator
PURPOSE: The purpose of the PokerGenerator assignment was to follow the five exercises and create code that shuffled through a deck of cards, returned multiple different scenarios (the probability of a ThreeOfAKind, etc.), and that created classes for Rational and Complex numbers. Please check the README for more.

OVERVIEW: I created classes and methods as per the excersises asked, as illustrated by the code. First, I created a Deck of cards to house cards, and I created methods across the board to generate cards and decks, to shuffle, etc. Next, I created Complex and Rational classes to demonstrate my understanding of these concepts of numbers. Finally, I created methods to illustrate my knowledge of finding a ThreeOfAKind, a Flush, and other poker terms, and calculated the probability of each one. Through this code, I show my knowledge of AP CS level excercises and my successful implementation.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: I would like to thank my father for helping me through understanding the most efficent way to search through a deck of cards for poker hands such as a Flush, Straight, etc. I would like to thank my AP CS teacher for providing me with these excercises
